# VBAcmd
Control software for Virtual Burrow Assay

Runs on Windows 7, Python 2.7 (WinPython distribution)

Instructions:
  - Rename config.py.template to config.py and if necessary correct DAQ / scaling parameters in the new .py file (git pull will not modify your local config.py file)
  - Run VBAcmd2.pyw

Requires:
  - Virtual Burrow Assay (see TK)
  - NI card with analog and digital in/out (e.g. USB-6008 http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/201986)
    - dev5:ai0 laser sensor   (scaling in script for MICRO-EPSILON ILD1302-50)
    - dev5:ai1 force sensor   (scaling in script for FUTEK FSH02664 load cell with FUTEK QSH00602 signal conditioner in +/-5 VDC mode)
    - dev5:ai2 servo position (scaling in script for FIRGELLI L12-30-50-12-I)
    - dev5:ai3 optional analog in (no scaling)
    - dev5:ao0 servo control  (scaling in script for FIRGELLI L12-30-50-12-I)
    - dev5/port0/line0 logical to disable closed loop mode during trial / enable closed loop mode during ITI
    - dev5/port1/line0 logical to indicate conditions satisfied for trial initiation

We are not coders. This is likely to be buggy, inefficient and recalcitrant to distribution across different platforms--and so welcome any assistance.
